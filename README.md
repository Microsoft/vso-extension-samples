# Visual Studio Online Extension Samples

This repo contains samples to help jump-start you in your development of [Extensions for Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/integrate/extensions/overview).

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

1. [Join the Visual Studio Partner program](http://www.vsipprogram.com/join) to get early access to the Extensions feature
2. Verify the Extensions feature has been enabled on your account by navigating to ```https://youraccount.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_admin/_apps/hub/ms.vss-extmgmt-web.manageExtensions-collection```.
3. Available local or cloud web server with HTTPS (IIS, Node.js, Azure Web App, Heroku, etc)

### Steps

The samples are published to the gallery. You can install them to your account by doing the following:

1. Go to https://youraccount.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_admin/_apps/hub/ms.vss-extmgmt-web.manageExtensions-collection
2. Locate the sample extension you want to install and click "Install".

#### Publishing the extensions yourself

If you want to edit the samples to play around with them, you will need to publish them yourself.

##### Before you begin
Follow the steps under Before you begin at [Publishing from the Command Line](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/extensions/publish/command-line). Save your Personal Access Token for later use.

##### Publish
1. Clone the samples  
    `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-extension-samples.git`  
    `cd vso-extension-samples`
    
2. Package and publish an extension  
    `cd <sample>`  
    Note: <sample> is the directory containing the sample you want to publish.
    
    `vset publish --publisher <P> --token <T> --share-with <A> --save`  
    Note: `<P>` is the ID of the publisher you created in the "Before you begin" steps. `<T>` is the Personal Access Token you generated in "Before you begin" above. `<A>` is the name of your VSO account.  
    Note: From now on, if you need to make changes to your manifest and re-publish the extension, you just type `vset publish`. Your token and share options are remembered.  
4. Install by going to https://youraccount.visualstudio.com/_admin/_apps/hub/ms.vss-extensionManagement-web.manageExtensions. Find the extension you published under the Shared With Me category. Click "Install" to install the extension.

You could contribute to build results view in different ways :
* As a section to any of your own contributed tab for build results view
* As a section to the existing "summary" tab in build results view
* As a tab to the build results view
